# DSA

This repository is dedicated to documenting some of the key algorithms that I utilize while solving problems on LeetCode. It serves as a reference for various data structures and algorithms, providing implementations. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all algorithms, but rather a curated selection of those that I find particularly useful.

## Contents

- Graph Traversal Algorithms

  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)

- Graph Shortest Path

  - Dijkstra's
  - Bellman Ford
    - Shortest Path Faster Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall

## How to run

Run modules from the repository root using Pythonâ€™s -m flag and the module path.

Example: Bellman-Ford (and SPFA) demo

```bash
python3 -m Graphs.ShortestPath.bellman_ford
```
